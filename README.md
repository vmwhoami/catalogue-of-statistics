## Catalogue-Of-Statisctics

In this project, I developed a frontend web application, catalogue of Cryptocurencies using CoinAPI  [COINAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/) 
to collect the data from my React Application.

The application features includes:

Listing all Crypto that is worth more than 1$.
Listing Crypto that is worth more than 10$.
Listing Crypto that is worth more than 50$.
Listing Crypto that is worth more than 100$.
Display an error if a the connection to the api is not established.
Dynamic routes for individual coin item and display priec stats for the last 15 days .

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure Node.js is running on your local machine

### Setup

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vmwhoami/catalogue-of-statisctics.git
$ cd catalogue-of-statisctics
```

Install modules:

```
npm install
```

### Setup your API Key

I used the  [COINAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/). Signup and get your key.
Create .env file, open it and add REACT_APP_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
